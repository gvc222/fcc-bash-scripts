Scripting using Bash
I have 4 programs to run using bash, where 1 program is to run the four programs.
-Questionnaire
-Countdown
-Bingo
-Fortune

countdown.sh needs an argument, so when running **./countdown.sh** with bash, place an argument next to it in numbers.

For example:
**./countdown.sh** 5

This will count down for 5 seconds.

Another way would be to change the **five.sh** script and change the number "3" next to the command, to anything you like.
